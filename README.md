# Project 1 - Flicks

Flicks is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [X] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [X] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [X] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [X] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [ ] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
- [ ] User can search for a movie.
- [ ] All images fade in as they are loading.
- [ ] Customize the UI.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Network requests
2. CollectionView

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I couldn't get the search bar working correctly. It wasn't
reloading the data correctly. The same applied when I was 
trying to implement infinite scrolling. Didn't have time to fix
it yet, but will look into it.
